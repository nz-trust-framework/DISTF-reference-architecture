# New Zealand Digital Identity Services Trust Framework

![Architecture and Reference Framework](media/arf-masthead.png)

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Context

### 1.2 Purpose

The Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Act 2023, together with its secondary legislation, lays down the requirements for a modern digital identity ecosystem in Aotearoa New Zealand. These instruments explain the *what* and *why*, but they do not spell out how to put those requirements into practice.

That “how” is the role of this Architecture and Reference Framework. It sets out the practical blueprint for operating a contemporary digital identity ecosystem in New Zealand and offers guidance to every participant, not just the providers and services accredited under the Trust Framework. By aligning with international standards, it also promotes cross-border interoperability, allowing New Zealand’s digital identity services to work seamlessly with those of other jurisdictions. This is crucial for a nation that relies on trade, tourism and the global mobility of its people.

### 1.3 Definitions
