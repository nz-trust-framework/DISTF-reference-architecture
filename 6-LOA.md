## 6. Levels of Assurance

Levels of Assurance (LoA) describe how confident you can be about the strength or robustness of a digital identity service or credential. They help both users and relying parties understand the strength of the checks that were done when the credential or service was created, bound to a device, or used to authenticate.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Work is currently underway to modernise the way Levels of Assurance are represented under the Trust Framework to make it easier for users and relying parties. This page will be updated as decisions are progressed.

### 6.1 Levels of Assurance under the Trust Framework

The Trust Framework currently utilises the [Levels of Assurance](https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/identity/identification-management/identification-standards/levels-of-assurance) established under the New Zealand Identification Standards.
