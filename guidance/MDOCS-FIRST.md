# Guidance on the Issuance of Verifiable Credentials – mDocs First Approach 

## Overview 

As part of our strategic move towards a more trusted, interoperable, and user-centric digital identity system, the Trust Framework Board is setting guidance for government agencies issuing verifiable credentials. Our recommendation is to adopt a **“Mobile Document (mDocs) First”** approach, meaning the preferred standards for verifiable credential issuance are either: 

-  ISO/IEC 18013-5 (for mobile driving licences and similar identity documents), or
-  ISO/IEC 23220 series (for mobile documents more broadly). 

These internationally recognised standards are mature, published, and have demonstrated wide adoption and interoperability across jurisdictions such as the United States, Australia, Japan, and the European Union. Aligning with these standards supports our ability to deliver digital services that are secure, privacy-enhancing, and usable across borders. 

## Recommended Approach 

### Prioritise ISO/IEC Standards 

Public sector agencies are encouraged to use ISO/IEC 18013-5 or the ISO/IEC 23220 series as the primary standards when developing or issuing mobile verifiable credentials. These specifications support secure, privacy-respecting, and offline-capable credentialing that aligns with international practice. 

### Why ISO/IEC is Preferred: 

-  International Standards: Developed through a rigorous, consensus-based international process, ISO/IEC 18013-5 and the 23220 series are globally accepted frameworks.
-  In person and online presentation: The standards support both in-person presentation (without requiring internet connectivity) and online presentation.
-  Privacy and User Control: They are designed to support selective disclosure and strong data protection, aligned with modern privacy and security expectations.
-  Proven Interoperability: Both have been the subject of extensive global interoperability testing and pilot implementations across multiple vendors and jurisdictions.
-  Demonstrated maturity: These ISO/IEC standards are published, stable, and have undergone extensive global interoperability testing and real-world adoption. This includes deployment across jurisdictions such as Australia, the EU, and the U.S., with participation from multiple vendors and governments. They have also been embraced by both Apple and Google who cover almost the entirety of the smartphone market, confirming that the technical implementation pathway is practical, available, and usable now by a vast majority of the public.
-  Adoption by Australia: The states, territories and Commonwealth government agreed in 2025 to “align to consistent technical industry standards (ISO/IEC 18013 and ISO/IEC 23220) to achieve interoperability for verifiable credentials”. An mDocs first approach therefore aligns New Zealand with Australia in accordance with the principles of the Single Economic Market (SEM).

### Use of Alternative Standards 

In limited circumstances where ISO/IEC standards may not be suitable due to specific operational, technical or legal reasons, agencies may consider using alternative models like the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VCDM), and upcoming SD-JWT-based Verifiable Credentials (SD-JWT VC). In such cases, agencies should engage early with the Trust Framework Group to discuss the rationale and seek endorsement for an alternative approach. 

Where private sector parties seek to package and issue government-backed information, the government agency can provide this information in formats aligned to the mDocs or not packaged in credential format, but this does not exclude other private sector parties from issuing it using other models where needed.  

### Support and Coordination 

Agencies are encouraged to work closely with the Trust Framework Group to ensure alignment with the broader digital identity ecosystem. Technical guidance and implementation support will be available to assist agencies in adopting and integrating these standards. 

## Summary 

Taking an mDocs-first approach aligns Aotearoa New Zealand with international best practice and positions our digital credential infrastructure for long-term interoperability, trust, and public confidence. While alternative approaches may be considered under exceptional circumstances, the use of ISO/IEC 18013-5 or the 23220 series is strongly recommended as the default path forward.
