## 7. Use Cases

This Reference Architecture (RA) will be driven by use cases.  There are some sections of the RA that will be referenced by many use cases e.g.
-	Trust Model
-	Levels of Assurance
-	Enrolment, verification, update and revocation of the credential 
-	Channels of engagement
-	Privacy, Accessibility and Inclusion requirements

Where there may be difference between use cases are in the areas of:
-	Governance
-	Data Models and namespace
-	Data Flows
-	Minimum levels of trust
-	Functions in the ecosystem

For each use case the following sections will be incorporated.
-	Overview:  Provides the scope and context of how this use case is being considered.
-	High level workflow:  The functions and data flow between the different services to support the use case.
-	Channels of verification: The channels that are available for the verification of the digital credentials
-	Legislation, Regulation and Standards:  The legislative and regulatory consideration and standards underpinning the use cases
-	Data and claim assertions:  The minimum data attributes that are required to deliver on this use case, where data minimisation is a core principle.
-	High level benefit profile:  High level benefits of the use case
-	High level risk profile: High level risks of the use case and high-level mitigations available
