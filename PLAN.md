# New Zealand Digital Identity Services Trust Framework

![DISTF Reference Architecture](media/reference-architecture.jpg)

## Reference Architecture - Plan

### 1 Introduction
-  Provides an introduction and high level overview of the purpose of the reference architecture
-  This includes the scope, and what is out of scope, of the reference architecture
-  It also provides "house keeping", for instance standard disclaimers, link to definitions, change log and anything else required to 'establish' the reference architecture.

### 2 New Zealand's Digital Identity Ecosystem
-  Establishes the basic form of New Zealand's modern digital identity ecosystem and introduces the basic model and key entities in that ecosystem
-  Begins to translate between the Trust Framework and commonly understood concepts (for instance, issuer vs. TF services)
-  Acknowledges the important role of Te ao Māori approaches to identity, noting the differentiation between identity and identification
-  Establishes use cases for the purpose of practically detailing many of the concepts included in the reference architecture (*to discuss*)
