# New Zealand Digital Identity Services Trust Framework

![Architecture and Reference Framework](media/arf-masthead.png)

The [Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Act 2023](https://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2023/0013/latest/LMS459583.html) establishes the legislative framework for *"the provision of secure and trusted digital identity services for individuals and organisations"* in Aotearoa New Zealand. 

While the legislation — along with its associated regulations and rules — establishes the legal foundation, clear guidance is still needed to define the architectural, business, and technological processes that will enable both regulated and unregulated participants, from the public and private sectors, to engage and jointly develop the kind of ecosystem the legislation envisions.
