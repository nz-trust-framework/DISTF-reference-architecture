# New Zealand Digital Identity Services Trust Framework

![Reference Architecture](media/trust-banner.jpg)

The [Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Act 2023](https://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2023/0013/latest/LMS459583.html) establishes the legislative framework for *"the provision of secure and trusted digital identity services for individuals and organisations"* in Aotearoa New Zealand. 

While the legislation, along with its associated regulations and rules, establishes the legal foundation, clear guidance is still needed to define the architectural, business, and technological processes that will enable both regulated and unregulated participants, from the public and private sectors, to engage and jointly develop the kind of ecosystem the legislation envisions.

## A Reference Architecture

This reference architecture sets out the practical blueprint for operating a secure, trusted, and interoperable digital identity ecosystem in Aotearoa New Zealand under the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Act 2023. 

Building on proven models from the European Union and other jurisdictions, it translates legislative requirements into clear technical and operational guidance for all ecosystem participants, across both public and private sectors. 

It defines the architecture, roles, data flows, trust mechanisms, and standards needed to issue, store, and present digital identity credentials, while aligning with global best practice to support cross-border interoperability. 

Developed through consultation with industry, government, and international partners, the reference architecture aims to provide a consensus-backed, technology-agnostic framework that gives implementers flexibility while ensuring compliance, consistency, and user-centric design. 

**The goal is to give all participants confidence in New Zealand’s digital identity ecosystem and to provide users with seamless use of trusted services at home and abroad.**
