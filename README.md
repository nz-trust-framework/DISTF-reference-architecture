# New Zealand Digital Identity Services Trust Framework
The [Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Act 2023](https://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2023/0013/latest/LMS459583.html) establishes the legislative framework for "the provision of secure and trusted digital identity services for individuals and organisations" in Aotearoa New Zealand. While the legislation, and its associated regulations and rules, established a legal framework, there is a need for clear guidance to establish the architectural, business and technological processes to enable the type of ecosystem envisioned by the legislation.
