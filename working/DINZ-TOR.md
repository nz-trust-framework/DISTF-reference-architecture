## Digital Identity New Zealand (DINZ) Reference Architecture - Terms of Reference


### 1. Purpose  
The purpose of this working group is to collaboratively articulate the Reference Architecture for digital identity in New Zealand. The Reference Architecture will be aligned with the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Act and other relevant standards and initiatives, while reflecting the needs of both public and private sectors.

### 2. Scope  
- Define, draft, and maintain the Reference Architecture.  
- Ensure alignment with the Trust Framework’s principles, rules, and legal requirements.  
- Produce outputs that are clear, practical, and accessible to the wider ecosystem.  
- Help inform future regulatory settings through development of the Reference Architecture.  

### 3. Membership  
- Members will be drawn from across Digital Identity NZ’s membership and stakeholders with relevant expertise.  
- Members are expected to set aside vendor-specific or commercial interests and act in the collective good of the work.  
- Participation is voluntary but requires a commitment to active contribution and collaboration.  
- Members may nominate a **substitute** to attend in their place where necessary, subject to prior agreement from the Chair(s).  

### 4. Roles  

#### Chair(s)

- Ensure meetings are effective, inclusive, and remain on topic.  
- Approve substitutions where members cannot attend.  

#### Reference Architecture Lead (Chris Goh)
-  Takes lead on drafting documents and faciliates detailed discussions.
-  Captures feedback and input and incorporates into revisions.
-  Facilitates conversation and indicates direction.

- Members are expected to review documents in advance to support constructive discussion.  

### 6. Ways of Working  
- All work will be co-ordinated through this private GitHub repository. Members (and approved subsitutions) will be granted access and therefore need a GitHub account.
- Discussions and deliberations of the group will remain **private** to encourage open and constructive dialogue.
- The **outputs of the group will be public** and made available to the broader digital identity community through a public GitHub repository.
- Members are expected to participate respectfully, collaboratively, and in good faith.
- Members are expected to contribute for the good of the ecosystem, and not for the benefit of organisations or companies they represent.

### 7. Decision-Making  
- Legal obligations take precedence at all times.  
- Where agreement cannot be found:  
  1. The document should remain ambiguous and reflect differing perspectives where possible.  
  2. If ambiguity is not workable, the **Trust Framework Board** will have final editorial authority.  

### 8. Review  
- These Terms of Reference will be reviewed annually, or earlier if required, by the group and confirmed by the Trust Framework Board.
